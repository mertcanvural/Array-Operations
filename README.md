# Sophomere Year Class Project - September 2023
The project includes functionalities such as sorting an array of strings using selection sort, counting the number of array elements that satisfy specific conditions within given ranges using for loops and while loops, counting the occurrences of certain values in an array using a switch statement, and counting the number of array elements that fall within a range defined by two values using a do-while loop. These operations can be utilized to manipulate and analyze arrays effectively, offering a versatile toolkit for array manipulation and analysis tasks in Java.
